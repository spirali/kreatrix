* Bytecode which is created on big endian machine is not compatible 
  with little endian bytecode, and vice versa.

* If you are using .tar.gz package on little endiang machine, 
  you must delete src/vminit/kxvminit.c before first running "make".
  I don't know how to exclude this file from package.
