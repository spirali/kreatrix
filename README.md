# Kreatrix

Kreatrix is a programming language inspired by IO, Self, Smalltalk and Python.
It was developed between 2006 and 2009 as parts of my bachelor and master theses.

I have put it online only for historic and nostalgic reasons
and I have no intention of continuing in development.

Some basic info:

* Object oriented programming language based on Self and IO
* Smalltalk-like syntax
* Python-like VM (in C)
* Modules: GTK-2, xml, sockets, threads, SDL
* GPLv2 license
* Original manual is lost :(
* [Examples](docs/examples)
* [Generated docs](docs/html)
* [VIM syntax highlighting](extra/kx.vim)
